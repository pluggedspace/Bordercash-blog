## How BorderCash Simplifies International Transfers with Stellar-Powered Ramps

When sending money across borders, users often face high fees, long delays, and frustrating bank processes. **BorderCash** is changing that. Built with seamless cross-border functionality at its core, BorderCash enables fast, affordable, and secure **international transfers** — all powered by the Stellar blockchain and a growing network of on/off ramps.

### What Makes BorderCash Different?

Unlike traditional banking systems that rely on a chain of intermediaries, BorderCash leverages **blockchain-based ramps** to make cross-border transfers efficient and borderless. With support for both **fiat and crypto deposits and withdrawals**, users can move money between countries with far less friction.

Here’s what you can do today with BorderCash:

#### 1. Deposit Funds via Ramps

Users can fund their BorderCash wallet through **fiat on-ramps** or **crypto ramps** available on the Stellar network. These ramps connect local financial infrastructure to blockchain systems, allowing you to move funds in from your local **bank account** or crypto wallet.

- Fiat on-ramps (local currency to digital USDC)  
- Crypto on-ramps (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin to USDC on Stellar)

#### 2. Withdraw to Local Destinations

Once funds are in the BorderCash wallet, users can **withdraw via off-ramps** to local bank accounts or wallets in supported countries.

- Withdrawals are fast and cost-effective  
- Funds land directly into the recipient’s **bank account**  
- Real-time conversion to local currencies  

#### 3. Built-In Direct Deposit Flow

Through our growing ramp network, international payments sent through BorderCash can land as **direct deposits** — with funds routed automatically to the recipient’s chosen destination.

Whether you’re paying a contractor overseas or sending family support back home, BorderCash handles the complexities in the background, letting you focus on what matters.
