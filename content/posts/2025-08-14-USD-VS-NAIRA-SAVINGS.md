## Introduction

In 2025, Nigerians are asking a crucial question: ‚ÄúShould I still be saving in naira?‚Äù With unpredictable exchange rates, inflation above 25%, and a skyrocketing cost of living, traditional NGN savings are no longer enough to preserve value.

Enter the dollar ‚Äî or more precisely, digital dollars. From tech-savvy workers in Lagos to families sending school fees abroad, more Nigerians are turning to platforms like **BorderCash** to convert and save in **USDC**, a stablecoin that tracks the U.S. dollar 1:1.

This article breaks down the trend, the reasoning, and how to start saving smart ‚Äî even with just ‚Ç¶5,000.

## The Naira Reality Check

### Naira at the Mercy of Inflation: A Recap

Between 2020 and 2025, the naira lost over 65% of its value against the dollar. In 2020, ‚Ç¶100,000 was worth about $275. In 2025, it's barely $60.

Inflation continues to eat into daily income. From rent to mobile subscriptions, every major cost now has a dollar price tag.

> üîç **Key Fact**: The CBN's liberalization of FX rates has made NGN‚ÄìUSD more volatile than ever ‚Äî with ramp platforms showing daily swings that can cost (or save) users thousands of naira.

## Why Nigerians Are Turning to USD (and How They‚Äôre Doing It)

### The Dollar: A Digital Piggy Bank

The new generation of savers isn‚Äôt stockpiling naira ‚Äî they‚Äôre converting funds to digital dollars and keeping them in stablecoin wallets. Here‚Äôs why:

- **Value Preservation:** The dollar holds value over time. The naira doesn‚Äôt.  
- **Easy Access:** Platforms like **BorderCash** offer instant ramp deposits that auto-convert to USDC.  
- **Borderless Spending:** Use your USDC savings to pay for school abroad, shop online, or exchange for NGN when needed.  

### üí° Popular Apps for USD Savings in 2025

- **BorderCash** ‚Äì Fast NGN deposits converted directly to USDC  
- **Risevest** ‚Äì Dollar investments and savings  
- **Bamboo** ‚Äì Stock-focused but includes USD wallet features  

## NGN vs USD: Pros, Cons, and Myths

| Criteria          | NGN                   | USD/USDC                          |
|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Access**        | Daily use in Nigeria  | Online or via fintech wallet      |
| **Stability**     | Highly volatile       | Pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar     |
| **Growth**        | Eroded by inflation   | Holds value or earns yield        |
| **Regulatory Risk**| Low                 | Moderate (depends on platform)    |

  _Maybe_, but you're exposed to fraud and zero recourse. **RAMPs provide safer conversion** with visible rates.
