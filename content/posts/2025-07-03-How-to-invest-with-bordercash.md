### 2. Why You Should Invest

In many African countries, the value of money weakens over time due to inflation, currency volatility, and economic uncertainty. Saving alone is no longer enough.

Hereâ€™s why investing makes sense:

- **Beat Inflation:** Investments grow over time and protect your moneyâ€™s value.  
- **Build Wealth:** Compound returns help grow your assets steadily.  
- **Reach Your Goals:** From owning a home to starting a business, investing brings dreams closer.  
- **Financial Freedom:** Let your money work for you.
