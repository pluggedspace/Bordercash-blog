Sending money to Nigeria shouldn’t feel like giving away part of your hard-earned income. Yet, for millions of Nigerians abroad, that’s exactly what happens every time they use traditional remittance platforms. From poor exchange rates to hidden fees, a significant portion of what you send can vanish before it even reaches your loved ones.

But it doesn’t have to be that way. Thanks to new technology like stablecoins and platforms like BorderCash, you can finally send money without being punished by foreign exchange losses.

The Real Cost of Sending Money to Nigeria

On the surface, most remittance platforms look harmless: a small fee here, a promise of fast delivery there. But the truth lies in the fine print—and especially the exchange rate.

Here’s how traditional providers quietly take more than they should:

Service Fees – Often between 1%–5% of the amount sent.

Exchange Rate Markup – You’re quoted a lower rate than the actual mid-market rate. This is the silent killer.

Hidden Charges – Additional fees for speed, payout method, or “cross-border conversion.”


> 📊 According to the World Bank, the average cost of sending $200 to sub-Saharan Africa is still over 6%, with banks charging up to 12%.



That’s $60–$120 lost per $1,000 sent—every time.

What Most People Don’t Know About FX Rates

There’s a rate you see on Google when you type 1 USD to NGN, and there’s the rate you get from remittance apps. The one on Google is called the mid-market rate—the true interbank rate.

Remittance providers often quote you ₦30–₦50 less per dollar and pocket the difference.

They:

Advertise "no fees", but skim off the rate.

Make it hard to track what was really lost.

Leave your family with less than expected.

The Game-Changer: Stablecoins

Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets, like the U.S. dollar. One of the most reliable is USDC (USD Coin).

Why USDC makes sense:

Always ≈ $1

No volatility

Fast + low-cost global transfers

Eliminates rate manipulation


This means you keep full value, without relying on traditional banks.
